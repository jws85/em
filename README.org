* em

  ~em~ is a small Python Qt script that launches an Emacs client frame
  using an existing Emacs server instance; or alternatively launches a
  new Emacs server if one does not already exist.

  Since *some of us* have really unoptimized, bloated Emacs installs,
  this is a fun bit of desktop whimsy while waiting for the server to
  start up :P

* Dependencies

  - Python 3
  - ~python3-qtpy~
  - ~python-pil~
